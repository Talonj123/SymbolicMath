# SymbolicMath
A C#.NET library to aid in the usage/simplification of symbolic math expressions.

My motivation is mainly for my own experience, but also to some extent, I am hopful about getting a C# symbolic math library out there.
The only other math library that I could find for .NET was MathDotNET and they use F#. Nothing against F#, I've used it on occation, but it seems like C# is more widely used.

Feel free to leave any commants/suggestions.
